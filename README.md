*DESCRIPTION*: I developed a fully responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to act as an online resume or CV that showcases an individual’s professional profile in a clean and interactive format. The main purpose of this website is to provide a modern platform for professionals to display their skills, experience, education, and work portfolio in an organized manner. The homepage begins with a header section, where the user’s name and designation are prominently displayed, along with an intuitive navigation menu that allows smooth scrolling to various sections of the page for seamless user experience. Following this is the About section, which includes a profile image and a brief introduction to the individual, complemented by a detailed list of skills, presented visually for better impact. To enhance the site’s utility, I integrated a Services section, where the user can highlight their offerings such as web development, app development, or consulting, each represented with descriptive text and relevant icons. The Portfolio section is dedicated to showcasing completed projects in a visually appealing grid format, helping potential employers or clients assess the user’s capabilities. Additionally, I incorporated Work Experience and Education details, arranged in a timeline style to make the career journey clear and easy to follow. A major feature of this website is the Contact section, which contains essential contact information and an interactive contact form that allows visitors to send messages directly through the website. To make data management simple and effective, I integrated the contact form with Google Sheets using a script, ensuring that all submissions are automatically stored without the need for a backend database or complex server-side code. This approach makes the solution lightweight, practical, and ideal for professionals who need a quick way to collect inquiries. For interactivity and a smooth user experience, I implemented JavaScript functionalities such as smooth scrolling on menu clicks, dynamic form handling, and user-friendly navigation. The entire design is optimized to be fully responsive, ensuring compatibility across all devices including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, achieved through CSS media queries and flexible grid layouts. The overall aesthetic of the website follows a clean, modern design language with well-chosen fonts, color schemes, and spacing, making the content easy to read and visually engaging. By combining core web technologies, I was able to create a practical and efficient solution that balances functionality with design. The portfolio website not only serves as a personal branding tool but also demonstrates technical proficiency in front-end development, user experience design, and API integration through Google Sheets for form data management. This project reflects my ability to create responsive, user-friendly web applications without relying on external frameworks, showcasing a strong understanding of web fundamentals and best practices in design and development.
